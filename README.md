# Iris Classification

This repository contains code and resources for performing iris classification using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this classification task is the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), and labeled with one of three classes (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).

## Model

A neural network model is used for the iris classification task. The model is implemented using the Keras library in Python. It consists of multiple layers of dense neurons with Softmax functions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sriharikg2003/LGMVIP--DataScience-1.git
